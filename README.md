# EMT-Simulation-for-Half-Bridge-Converter
These are electromagnetic transient simulation projects for two-level half-bridge converters built on PSCAD/EMTDC.
The running environment is PSCAD/EMTDC v4.5.
The TwoLevelHBC.pswx is a workspace that includes two projects, i.e., the HBC.pscx and UserDefinedHBC.pscx.
The UserDefinedHBC.pscx is designed according to the algorithms proposed by Shilin Gao, Yankan Song and Ying Chen at Tsinghua University.
